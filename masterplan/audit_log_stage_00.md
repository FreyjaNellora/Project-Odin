# Audit Log — Stage 00: Skeleton

## Pre-Audit
**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Auditor:** Claude Opus 4.6

### Build State
- Compiles: N/A — no project existed prior to this stage
- Tests pass: N/A
- Previous downstream flags reviewed: N/A — Stage 0 has no upstream dependencies

### Findings
No prior code exists. This is the first stage. All work starts from scratch.

### Risks for This Stage
- **Huginn macro design** (Section 2.16): The `huginn_observe!` macro must compile to absolute nothing when the feature is off. Any side effect in macro arguments would violate this. Risk mitigated by accepting `$($args:tt)*` and expanding to `{}` when off.
- **Buffer pre-allocation memory** (Section 2.15): Default 65,536 entries with raw `[u64; 16]` data fields. Each `TraceEvent` is ~184 bytes, so the full default buffer is ~12MB. Acceptable for development builds.

### Deliverables Check

| Deliverable | Status | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| Directory structure (odin-engine, odin-ui, odin-nnue, tools) | Complete | All directories exist with expected layout |
| Cargo workspace with `odin-engine` member | Complete | `cargo build` succeeds |
| `huginn` feature flag (default off) | Complete | `odin-engine/Cargo.toml` has `[features] huginn = []` |
| `huginn_observe!` macro (both branches) | Complete | OFF: compiles to nothing (verified by binary inspection). ON: records to buffer |
| `HuginnBuffer` ring buffer (65,536 slots) | Complete | 8 unit tests + 3 integration tests pass |
| `TraceEvent` struct with all required fields | Complete | ts, session_id, trace_id, gate, stage, phase, level, data all present |
| Buffer wraps silently when full | Complete | `test_buffer_wraps_silently_when_full` passes — no panic, no allocation |
| UI scaffold (React + Vite + TypeScript) | Complete | `npm install && npm run dev` works (Vite 7.3.1, React-TS template) |
| `.gitignore` | Complete | Covers target/, dist/, node_modules/, *.onnue, *.jsonl |

### Code Quality

#### Uniformity
All Rust code follows naming conventions per MASTERPLAN Section 6: modules are snake_case (`huginn`, `buffer`), types are PascalCase (`HuginnBuffer`, `TraceEvent`, `Phase`, `Level`), functions are snake_case (`new_trace`, `record`, `monotonic_ns`), constants are SCREAMING_SNAKE (`DEFAULT_BUFFER_CAPACITY`, `MAX_DATA_FIELDS`). No mixed conventions found.

#### Bloat
No unnecessary code. The `HuginnBuffer` implementation is minimal: `new`, `with_default_capacity`, `new_trace`, `record`, `len`, `is_empty`, `get`, `session_id`, `current_trace_id`, plus two private helpers. No over-abstraction — no traits, no generics, no builders.

#### Efficiency
Buffer uses `Vec` pre-allocated once at construction (no allocation during `record`). `record()` uses array index + `copy_from_slice` — O(1) per call. Monotonic clock uses `OnceLock` (lock-free after initialization). ID generation uses `AtomicU64` (lock-free).

#### Dead Code
No dead code. `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features` produces zero warnings. All public items are used in tests. Empty module stubs (board, eval, gamestate, movegen, protocol, search, variants) contain only comments — no dead code.

#### Broken Code
No broken code found. All 11 tests pass (8 unit + 3 integration with huginn; 2 integration without).

#### Temporary Code
No temporary code. No TODO comments. No placeholder implementations that need to be replaced.

### Search/Eval Integrity
N/A — no search or eval exists at Stage 0.

### Future Conflict Analysis
**Dependency map (MASTERPLAN Appendix A):** Stage 0 is a dependency for ALL subsequent stages. Key concerns:
- The `huginn_observe!` macro signature (buffer, gate, stage, phase, level, data...) is now a contract. All future stages will use this pattern. Signature changes would cascade to every stage.
- `Phase` and `Level` enums may need new variants as stages add new engine phases. These are `#[repr(u8)]` and use explicit discriminants, so adding variants is additive and safe.
- `TraceEvent` data field uses `[u64; 16]` — this limits each observation to 16 raw values. If future stages need more, the `MAX_DATA_FIELDS` constant would need to increase (cascading to buffer memory usage).

### Unaccounted Concerns
None. Stage 0 is pure scaffolding — minimal surface area for hidden problems.

### Reasoning & Methods
1. Built and tested in both configurations: `cargo build` and `cargo build --features huginn`
2. Ran `cargo test` and `cargo test --features huginn` — all pass
3. Built release binary without huginn, searched for "huginn" strings — none found
4. Ran `cargo fmt -- --check` — clean after formatting
5. Ran `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features` — zero warnings
6. Verified `npm install && npm run dev` for odin-ui — Vite dev server starts on port 5173
7. Manually inspected all source files for naming consistency, dead code, and spec compliance

### Issue Resolution
No issues opened during Stage 0 — no blocking, warning, or note-level issues.
